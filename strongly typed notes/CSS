CSS
style = ""

key1:value1 ; key2: value2;...

# similiar to . but for id

can have more than one class style for an attribute
class = "xyz abc"
 
more specific modifiers override less specific attributes 
	style in <p> most specific
	class
	P{} least

in dev tools element.style= overrides everything else

style sheets override so whatever comes last wins the race

em = emphasis = em is size relative to all size by default
			if default size is 16pt... 1 em = 16pt
			2em would = 32pt.
