API - Applictation programming interface
webservices return data the most popular is JSON or XML
CLient is whoever made the request
Stateless - never remembers - no context is typically stored between requests - server efficient
Web API to replace asp.net and WCF
		
		Odata ex
		http://myserver.com/bikes?$select=name,price&$filterprce gt 1000

		SQL can use webservices to reach stored procedurea as http endpoints 

XML extensible Markup Language
	<?xml version ='1.0'?>
	can support relational tables
	and sql join relationships

	XML is very wordy
	Bing has a XML formatter

	Visual studio has a paste special option to paste xml as classes

JSON - Javascript object notation

ex
"{\"Name\":\"thingamajig\", \"ID\":\"A100\"}

var thing 1 = {Name: "thingamajig", ID: "A100"};
var thing 2 = JSON.parse('{"Name": "thingamajig" "ID":"A100"}')
JSON BECAME ECMA standard in 2003

[ { : , }] only structural tokens JSON uses everything else is data
values - object array number string true false null
object {string : value , string : value...}
array [value, value, value...]
/b bacpace
\feed caracter 
\n new line
Properties are defined as name object pairs
"PartNumber": "1234"
numbers are simply listed as digits
{"PartNumber": "1234", "id" : 1234}
Object
{
	"Widget" :{
	"Name": "thingamajig"
	"Part": [
	"PartNumber": "1234",
	"PartNumber": "4567"
	]

	}e
}
For c# parsing JSON the recommendation is to use  Newtonsoft.Json

dynamic objects in JSon is kinda like var in c# 

serialize - when we send items accross the internet we send them in text taking object in c# and sending them accross the internet requires them to be serialized or stringified
JSON and dates suck - they are counted as milisecond from a date in the 70s
JSON Metadate  == data from where it came from or documentation


Async = create a parales process to do this task 
await = execute the code when the async is done


    [ApiController] this attribute will make functions return JSON

    Controllerbase = web api
    Controller = mvc

    Restfull - URL that points to a resource

    https used to encrypt data uses a public key private key system
    the user has the public key and the server has the private key

Azure- 
Vms 
Web Apps 
Functions
Azure SQL 99% compatible with regular sql server
Storage 
	a netwrok disc drive
	url based blob storage

	Web APP vs function
	functions should be used when very simple things need to be accomplished and not a full web app

		Function is a class that has to have a function called 'Run'
		azure functions is a serverless compute service 
		responds to events and executes an action
		Events are URL triggers  "Queue, timer, eventgrid,   "
			they look a lot like a webapi request
		a way to add new functionality to a website without rewriting code
