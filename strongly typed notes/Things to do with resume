Elevator speech

i've loved  computers my whole life and had one since I could type.
I always knew I'd end up in this field at some point.
That's why I decided to take the Cincy code-it bootcamp with max technical training loved every minute
where we coded almost everyday for 11weeks and I gained a strong understanding of object oriented programming languages
I know I have a strong work ethic. I worked with my dad for 10 years helping him run his business.
learned that from him.  Being in the retail world like a computer I've learned to have many processes open at a time 
and learned how to prioritized the different problems
and I brought that with me to every company.  I know these values can transfer well into any field.
I'm very excitedto be here today interviewing for a software developer position.

I've been a computer geek my whole life, I had my own ever since I could type and always new I'd end up in this field someday
That's why I decided to take the Cincy code it boot camp with Max Technical training where I became a scrum master
Where we learned how to become full stack developers learning things from sql to c# to js and many different alternatives
I had two major favorite things in this bootcamp first, i used to be very stubborn I would see a problem and think i know the answer
 and I found that helping my other classmates has opened my eyes up to different ways of thinking and solving problems and that made 
 me a stronger more resourceful programmer.
 My second was learning the frameworks that tied to two technologies together I found that was when I was most challenged and my knowledge of the technologies was tested
 That made me a more diverse developer 

 I worked in the retail field for a little over 10 years and I found that I have a very strong work ethic 
 Sadly the retail world when poeple see someone working efficiently and quickly they want help and Ive always been someone to say "yes I can do that"
 so I found my self working on many different projects
