iF table has foriegn key dependancies then it cannot be made first.  
make sure you hide the password
Reviewer is the guy who is allowed to view all and manage requests
isadmin is the one who can insert update and delete
The Logged in user will be the user id for requests
Most users are not admins or reviewers

Creating prodicts you want to chose the vendor by the vendor name not the id
using a drop down box

when you update a product it will read the prodict on the screen.  it should select the vendor for tha product


Request== Status and total are maintained by the application... MAKE THE STATUSES UPPERCASE

request.total = THE Total of the request for all request lines

need a method to pass in request id update the request and return the total

for requests it should have a details and an edit button requests shld have a lines button

ProductID in requests should have a drop down or list of some kind where they can pick a product

When the request is made and submitted for review if it is less than 50$ it goes straight thru if over 50$ it goes to Review.. and a reviewer needs to approve it.  They have the option to approve or reject.  Status goes to approve..  if rejected.. text box come up and the user can see why


Vendor PO - Goes to vendor looks at approved requests summarizes what we need from the vendors to complete our requests

Request line page should show all requests lines with the same request id

Will use postman to test our system

Postman monitors THE JsON information

create a dynamic search
