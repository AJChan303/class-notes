Java for C# Developers

Very similar Any Object oriented languages are gonna be similiar

Key differences
	visual studio vs ecplipse sts
	eclipse has many flavors
	Java has a lot more options

	spring - standardized way to create controllers for the web

	Frameworks .Net vs sdk (standard development kit)

	.net 'solutions' vs Java 'project'

	Syntax differences

	C# syntax shortcuts

	 properties in java have to be explicit in there get and set

JDK, SDK 
	Java 8 (JDK 1.8) minimum version

	Java needs to be installed on that machine with the right verion

	Source Files Class files

	instead of .cs its a .java file

	binary file means it contains machine data cannot be read as text
	files are stored in a bin folder
	source - text files to be made into binary files

	JRE Jave runtime environment - what compiles and runs code

	in Java the binary file is called . class

IDE
eclipse sts
netbeans
intelliJ

==Perspectives==
	Layout of ecllipse will change depending on what you are doing 

Import
	-general
		-exsisiting project into workspace
	Java used . notation to specify folders

Inheritance : is extends in java
import or using
ctrl space is like tab tab in studio
ex sysout ctrl space

public class HelloWorldApp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		System.out.println("another line");
		System.out.print("a");
		System.out.print("a");
		System.out.print("a");
		System.out.print("a");

		int a = 0;
		String title = "hello world";

	}

}
output
Hello World
another line
aaaa

cannot use the var type to make a variable



Reference types are all capitalized and value types are lowercase

for reference types using == will sometimes not work
 	there are methods that will see if things are equal

==refactor==
	can be used to turn lines of code into a method

Exception catches some methods have the has in front to catch exceptions

Classes in Java
	UML unified modeling language
	ORM object relational mapping
	.net EF Java JPI

	@ - signifies a "attribute" for java
	@Entity
	@ColumnName("....")
	getters and setter must be pulbic and must be named very specificly
	Class names Title case
	instance varialbe are camelCase

	getters and setter must starat with 'get' or 'set' plus instance variable name camelCased

	package same as namespace
	creating constructor rt. click source create constructor

	line item combination of a product and a qty that u want

	java called classes being inherited from super like base in c#

	Ch08 good for inheritance : 

	implementes for interfaces instead of colon

	interfaces are the same as c# with the exception of default methods implemented in java 8

	interfaces by convention are suffixed by -able and an i before the name

	project 11-4 tic tac toe

	foreach is for in is :

	Making lists or arrays of value types need to be displayed as reference types int = Integers


	File input/output

	Advanced exception handling

	jdbc - EF of Java

	ORM / JPA

	Restful with spring framework
