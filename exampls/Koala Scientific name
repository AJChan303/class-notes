Koala Habitat

Koalas live in southeastern and eastern Australia — in the states of Queensland, new South Wales, South Australia and Victoria — in the eucalyptus forests and woodlands. They live in eucalyptus trees and spend most of their time wedged between forks in the tree's branches.

Koala Behavior

Nocturnal mammals, koalas sleep for up to 16 hours a day. They are arboreal, which means that they live in trees. They
do not live in big groups but rather prefer to be alone. Females are solitary and occupy distinct home ranges that they
rarely leave. In the more fertile areas, these ranges overlap; in areas where suitable food trees are scarce they tend to be
larger and more exclusive. Males are not territorial, but do not tolerate one another, particularly not during the breeding
season: dominant individuals attack subordinate ones, and most adult males carry scars on their face, ears and forearms
as a result.


Koalas have soft, wool-like fur that is gray above and white
below. Their fur is mostly white on the underside below the
neck, and their ears have long white hairs on the tips. The
koala resembles a bear, but is actually a marsupial, a special
kind of mammal which carries its young in a pouch.

Koalas consume eucalyptus leaves and bark from 12 different
eucalyptus tree species. They also consume mistletoe and
